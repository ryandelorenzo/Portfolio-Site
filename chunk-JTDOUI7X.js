The motivation for this was mainly due to Unreal using C++, a very powerful coding language that can be applied to many other software applications. This Udemy course was completed in order to become more comfortable with the Unreal Engine as well as C++. Learned C++ principles such as syntax, objected oriented programming, and Unreal Engine specific C++ functions. Throughout the tutorial, refactoring was used to future proof coding and allow for easy scalablility. Intrefaces and child classes were used to add multiple enemies, breakable objects and pick up items. The end result is an open world and "dev room" where a developer can easily implement and test new features. From this project I am hoping to develop more personal projects with Unreal Engine being my main engine. This excel my skills as a C++ coder and game developer.

But instead of doubling the money, Henry wont stop doubling and chases you! Or the recursive dog, when pet, his tail will recursively get larger. Building off my previous games, the personal focus of this project was to create a cinematic experience similar to a "walking simular" game (ie Firewatch, Layers of Fear, Abzu, What Remains of Edith Finch). Additionally, I wanted to use custom assets for this game jam. The majority of assets such as, voice lines and sprites were customized or created for this gamejam. Heavy scripting and sound design was done in C# for cutscene like sequences to continue Peepo journey throughout the gamejam and create cinematic gameplay.
