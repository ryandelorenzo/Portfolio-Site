<p>Welcome to my website! And please excuse the appearnce, this is an early version of my site. 
    Here I will show case projects I have worked on and other note worthy information about me.
    This site will be continously updated to become more polished.

    This  was created with the aim of learning Angular and Typescript to be able to showcase my projects. This is an early iteration of the site, I hope to get this site onto 
    a cloud server (most likely Azure) to further excel my knowledge of cloud computing.
